# 213Blog
This is a project for Computer Science 213 where I will be creating a simple blog system. I have been trying to use a somewhat MVC structure for the app.
The files that the user will hit is the logic (controllers) files that then loads in a view. And in my Classes folder there is files that are trying to operate as my Models. Only had around 4 weeks to finish this project so no time for pretty url's or to build my own routing system that loads controllers so this will do for now.
